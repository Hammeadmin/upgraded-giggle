# Enhanced Invoice Management with Team Integration and Email System

1. New Tables
   - `invoice_emails` - Track email communications for invoices
   - `team_job_participation` - Track team member participation in jobs

2. Enhanced Tables
   - Add team assignment fields to invoices
   - Add job details from orders
   - Add email tracking fields

3. Security
   - Enable RLS on all new tables
   - Add policies for organization-level access
   - Ensure proper team member access controls
